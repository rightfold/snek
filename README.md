# SNEK

SNEK is a programming language. This repository contains a compiler and a
standard library implementation.

A PHP code generator is included.

## Features and status

 - [x] Purity
 - [x] Currying
 - [ ] Rank-N polymorphism
 - [x] Higher-kinded types
 - [ ] Path-dependent types
 - [ ] Generalized algebraic data types
 - [x] Strict evaluation

## Compiler internals

This project is mostly an exercise of implementing a type checker for System Fω.
The compiler implementation is kept as simple as possible. It has a number of
stages, shown in the following figure.

## Examples

    ; Comments start with a semicolon and extend until the end of the line.

    ; The identity function. The fn special form denotes a lambda function. The
    ; first argument to fn is the parameter list. When the parameter list is a
    ; list (delimited by parentheses), the lambda function takes values as
    ; arguments. When the parameter list is an array (delimited by brackets),
    ; the lambda function takes types as arguments, giving rise to polymorphism.
    (fn [t *] (fn (x t) x))

    ; Applying the identity function to a Boolean value. Note how arrays are
    ; used to pass types as arguments, and lists are used to pass values as
    ; arguments.
    ([(fn [t *] (fn (x t) x)) bool] true)

    ; Structs, also known as records.
    (.name {name "rightfold"
            dead false})
